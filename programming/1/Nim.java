/* 
  GOAL: Be the player to remove the last stone.
  RULES:
  - bag contains 12 stones initially
  - a move consists of removing 1-3 stones from the bag
  CODE:
  - turn starts with prompting user for num of stones to remove
  - tell user how many AI removed (random 1-3)
  - continue until there is a winner
  -Thanks to Taylor Grant-Knightly.
