CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>

- Helps to understand the code given
- Help track where 
- Visualize and get a feel for the code


CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>

- Class time to implement in the course
- 


BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>

- Iteration - Loops and recursion
- Implementing new code 
- Students are having problems with a paricular concept
- Debugging and to figure out the Complex code output without the computer(solustions that cannot be readily solved in their heads)


LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>
- Code that simple and does not include loops and lists


PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
 * tracing as an assignment
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer
 * etc 
> 
- Model how code tracing is done
- Use colors and diagrams
- Talking out the code first
- Color coding each student or groups contribution
- Maybe have printed paper with code already on it
